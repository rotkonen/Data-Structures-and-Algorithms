## Task 1

Refer to the following link. Explain how the Knapsack Algorithm works:
https://monicagranbois.com/knapsack-algorithm-visualization/

The Knapsack Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that solves the classic Knapsack problem. The Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which a set of items, each with a weight and a value, must be selected and placed into a knapsack with a limited capacity, such that the total value of the items placed in the knapsack is maximized.

## Task 2

Refer to the following link. What are the difference between the brute force and the optimized solutions to the Knapsack problem.
https://www.educative.io/blog/0-1-knapsack-problem-dynamic-solution

The Knapsack problem is an optimization problem in which we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a capacity, and we need to maximize the total value of items that can be put into the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

The brute force approach to solve the Knapsack problem is to generate all possible combinations of items that can be put into the knapsack and calculate their total value, and then choose the combination with the maximum value that fits within the knapsack's capacity. The time complexity of this approach is exponential, which means that it's not practical for large inputs.

## Task 3

There are different implementations of the stair case problem in the following link:
